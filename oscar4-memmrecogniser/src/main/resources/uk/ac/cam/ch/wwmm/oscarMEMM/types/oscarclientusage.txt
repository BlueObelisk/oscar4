Usage:

OscarClient takes the following parameters:

SOURCE DEST URL [FLOW]

SOURCE = source file. If the filename ends in .xml, it will be assumed to be
in SciXML, otherwise it will be treated as plain text.

DEST = destination file.

URL = the URL of the Oscar3 Process servlet. If this is running on your local
machine, it will be:

http://localhost:8181/Process

FLOW (optional) = an OscarFlow command sequence. 
Place these in quote marks. Examples:
"recognise resolve numbersaf inline" - gives inline XML
"recognise subtypes resolve numbersaf inline" - as above, with subtypes
"recognise resolve numbersaf" - just gives the SAF
"data" - gives experimental data XML
