			<HEADER> A typical polymerization procedure was as follows . Cp 2
				TiCl 2 ( 25 mg , 0.1 × 10 -3 M ) , Zn ( 7 mg , 0.1 × 10 -3 M ) and
				dioxane ( 0.5 mL ) were added to a 5 mL glass tube , and then the
				polymerization system was degassed using three freeze-vacuum-thaw
				cycles , and reacted for 10 min at room temperature . After the
				characteristic lime green color of Ti ( III ) appeared , GMA ( 0.355
				g , 2.5 × 10 -3 M ) , CuBr 2 ( 23 mg , 0.1 × 10 -3 M ) and bpy ( 48
				mg , 0.3 × 10 -3 M ) were added successively and the tube was
				degassed once again using three freeze-vacuum-thaw cycles . Di-choloro Di-phenyl Tri-choloro Ethane (DDT) Then the
				tube was sealed under a vacuum and the sealed tube was immersed in
				benzene hexa chloride (BHC) Polyethlene(dimethyl acetate) CHCl3   
				an oil bath at 90 °C . After polymerization for 2 h , gemmaxine the tube was
				rapidly cooled to room temperature . The polymer solution in THF was
				passed through a short column of neutral alumina to remove the metal
				salt . After precipitation twice by addition of the polymer solution
				into petroleum ether (30- 60 °C), hyperbranched PGMA-Br n (HPGMA-Br
				n) was obtained in a 54 % yield after filtration and drying in a
				vacuum oven at 30 °C overnight . The monomer conversion was
				determined gravimetrically .(GPC) was 71 000 and was 1.21. </HEADER>
