	<CURRENT_TITLE>Induction of calcium influx through TRPC5 channels by
		cross-linking of GM1 ganglioside associated with alpha5beta1 integrin
		initiates neurite outgrowth.</CURRENT_TITLE>
	<ABSTRACT>Previous studies demonstrated that cross-linking of GM1
		ganglioside with multivalent ligands, such as B subunit of cholera
		toxin (CtxB), induced Ca2+ influx through an unidentified,
		voltage-independent channel in several cell types. Application of CtxB
		to undifferentiated NG108-15 cells resulted in outgrowth of axon-like
		neurites in a Ca2+ influx-dependent manner. In this study, we
		demonstrate that CtxB-induced Ca2+ influx is mediated by TRPC5
		channels, naturally expressed in these cells and primary neurons. Both
		Ca2+ influx and neurite induction were blocked by TRPC5 small
		interfering RNA (siRNA). Pretreatment of NG108-15 cells with
		neuraminidase increased cell-surface GM1 and greatly enhanced the
		signal. GM1 was not directly associated with TRPC5 but rather with
		alpha5beta1 integrin, which opened the channel through a signaling
		sequence after cross-linking of the GM1/integrin complex. This cascade
		included autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and subsequent
		activation of phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and phosphoinositide-3
		kinase [PI(3)K]. Pharmacological blockers that inhibited tyrosine
		kinase, PLC, and PI(3)K suppressed both CtxB-induced Ca2+ influx and
		neurite outgrowth. These were also suppressed by SK&amp;F96365, a
		nonspecific transient receptor potential channel blocker. Confocal
		immunocytochemistry revealed that GM1 cross-linking induced
		colocalization of GM1 with these signaling elements in sprouting
		regions of plasma membrane. In primary cerebellar granular neurons
		(CGNs), TRPC5 was detected at 2 d in vitro (2 DIV), a stage
		corresponding to CtxB-stimulated Ca2+ influx. Neurite outgrowth in
		CGNs, determined at 3 DIV, was accelerated by CtxB and suppressed by
		TRPC5 siRNA and the above blockers. The crucial role of GM1 was
		indicated with CGNs from ganglio-series null mice, in which growth of
		axons was significantly retarded.</ABSTRACT>
