The term (and its alternative 'polar aprotic solvent') is a misnomer and is therefore discouraged. Such solvents are usually not aprotic but protophilic (and at most weakly protogenic). In describing a solvent it is better to be explicit about its essential properties, e.g. dipolar and non-protogenic.

comment: [IUPAC]:(in drug design) Quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) are mathematical relationships linking chemical structure and pharmacological activity in a quantitative manner for a series of compounds. Methods which can be used in QSAR include various regression and pattern recognition techniques.\nQSAR is often taken to be equivalent to chemometrics or multivariate statistical data analysis. It is sometimes used in a more limited sense as equivalent to Hansch analysis. QSAR is a subset of the more general term SPC.

comment: Ross: a natural chemical that binds to these receptors
comment: [IUPAC]: In biochemistry: if it is possible or convenient to regard part of a polyatomic molecular entity as central, then the atoms, groups or molecules bound to that part are called ligands. Biochemical usage is thus wider, in that the central entity can be polyatomic. Thus H+  may be a ligand for proteins and for citrate as well as for O2− . It may even be a ligand for a univalent entity such as acetate: in other circumstances, AcO−  may be the ligand for H+, since the definition makes it clear that the view of which entity is central may change for convenience. Thus, four calcium ions are ligands for calmodulin, when the protein is regarded as central: four carboxylate groups of calmodulin ligate (are ligands of) each calcium ion when this ion is regarded as central. It is the ligand that is said to ligate the central entity, which is said to be ligated. When the hormone binding to a receptor is called a ligand, the receptor is thus regarded as the central entity. Biochemists should bear in mind that the usage in inorganic chemistry has been that ligands bind only single atoms, so they should be cautious in fields such as bioinorganic chemistry where confusion may be possible.

comment: colin batchelor and elena beisswanger (University of Jena, Germany)\n\nemail from Colin:\n\nThere are omissions from the upper chemistry ontology (it's not exhaustive) and this is one of them.\nI was talking to Elena Beisswanger (University of Jena, Germany) about this, and we decided that MoleculeComplex should be a class on the same level as Molecule.  It's disjoint with Molecule and it has molecules as determinate parts.  We don't have a necessary+sufficient definition in OWL for that one but it's something like

comment: [Wiki]:Tautomers are isomers of organic compounds that readily interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization. Commonly this reaction results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertible by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.
